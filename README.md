fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974,
he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale.
Various natural phenomena – like the romanesco cabbage – have some fractal features.

Now, it’s your turn to modelize some magnificent fractals!

Now that you took over your first graphical library: the miniLibX,
it’s time for you to light all the pixels of your screen at the same time!
This new project will be the opporunity for you to hone your miniLibX skills, to make you discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.
