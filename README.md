# Fractol

fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974,
he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured".

A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale.

Various natural phenomena – like the romanesco cabbage – have some fractal features.

Now, it’s MY TURN to modelize some magnificent fractals using some concepts of poptimization in computer graphics!
- I used multi-threading to optimize the speed of drawing!
- Each thread is respensible to draw a part of the screen
- In `includes/header.h` change `define DIV <x>` to change nbr of threads used
